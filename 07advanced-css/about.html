        <h1>A Brief History</h1>
            <p>In 2019, Caleb and Joe were just a couple of friends and students in the <a href="https://www.uvu.edu/artdesign/degrees/#graphicdesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UVU graphic design program</a> . Back then, they couldn't help but notice that the design scene in Utah was missing something that truly spoke to them. So, they took matters into their own hands and launched Equity Business Solutions. What began as a small-scale operation has since blossomed into a successful Provo-based business, and they've expanded into a tight-knit team of four, proudly serving the whole of northern Utah from their downtown Provo hub.</p>
